	You've just learned about variables, conditionals.
	Just from knowing those two topics, you can do so much!
	
	Let's try to make a simple program that responds to the user.
	We're going to recreate the Magic 8 Ball!!!
			
			Never heard of it? That's ok!

					You got this!

  -------------------------------------------- 

	How a Magic 8 Ball Works:

	The user asks a question and vigoriously shakes the ball. 
	Then the ball will respond with one of twenty responses, chosen at random. 

	That's pretty simple right?

  -------------------------------------------- 

	Part 1: 
	Print instructions on the screen and 
	prompt the user to ask a question

	Tip: Don't forget to import the readline-sync module!

  -------------------------------------------- */

let message = `Ask a question that you wish to ask from deep within your heart, 
  and be prepared to recieve advice from the great magic 8 ball`;
  console.log(message);
  
  const READLINE = require("readline-sync");













/* -------------------------------------------- 

	Part 2: Next, we need to randomly select a response from 20 options.

	Randomly select a number from 0 - 19 
	Use that to select from the following responses:
		0 - It is certain.
		1 - It is decidedly so.
		2 - Without a doubt.
		3 - Yes - definitely.
		4 - You may rely on it.
		5 - As I see it, yes.
		6 - Most likely.
		7 - Outlook good.
		8 - Yes.
		9 - Signs point to yes.
		10 - Reply hazy, try again.
		11 - Ask again later.
		12 - Better not tell you now.
		13 - Cannot predict now.
		14 - Concentrate and ask again.
		15 - Don't count on it.
		16 - My reply is no.
		17 - My sources say no.
		18 - Outlook not so good.
		19 - Very doubtful.

	Look up Math.random to see how you can use it to select a random number.

let  responceArray = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", "19"];

  let randomresponce = responceArray[Math.floor(Math.random() = responceArray.length)];
  consule.log(randomresponce)


















/* -------------------------------------------- 

	Part 3: Customize it!

	Select your own theme and use case and modify your code!
